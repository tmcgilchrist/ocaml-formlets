What's this?
------------
A preprocessor providing 
   * Links-style XML syntax
   * Formlets syntax

Most of the work is in the lexer.  Unfortunately, since the Camlpl4
lexer isn't extensible in the right way (there isn't a way to hook in
a lexer switch on a certain character) we have to copy the whole thing
and modify it slightly.  We use a stack of lexing functions to
maintain state in the same manner as the Links lexer implementation.

The parser is comparatively simple: preprocess all of the XML
literals, handing off to the regular camlp4 parser to parse OCaml
expressions.

Why don't we just use the preprocessor provided by Ocsigen?
-----------------------------------------------------------

It would be fairly easy to modify xmlp4, the Ocsigen preprocessor, to
include formlets syntax.  We choose not to follow this route for at
least the following reasons:

  1. the syntax is rather heavy, since it uses camlp4 quotation at the
     expression level.  To declare an empty <p/> node, for example,
     you have to write

        << <p/> >>

  2. nesting is broken.  As in camlp4, "$" is the splicing character,
     and the lexer uses a crude scanahead to find the closing "$",
     which ignores all grammatical and lexical structure.  Thus, one
     may write

        << <p>$str:"x"$</p> >>

     to splice in the string "x", or 

        let dollar = "$" in
        << <p>$str:dollar$</p> >>

     to splice in the string "$", but not

        << <p>$str:"$"$</p> >>
